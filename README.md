This repository contains detailed **PDF notes per module** from the 8-course specialization, with a focus on the **first 7 courses** which cover core concepts and tools in data analytics. The 8th course was a capstone project/portfolio, so no formal notes were taken.

> 📌 This course was completed with a scholarship from [Google](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics).
